FInal balance and log of all trades during backtest using mean reversion
Final balance is 10079.93, profit of 79.93 since starting balance is 10000
2. Trade Log:
Each line in the trade log represents a buy or sell order that was executed during the backtest. Hereâ€™s how to interpret them:

Buy:
Example: Buy 2.7083330750465637 shares at 73.84616088867188 on 2020-02-24 00:00:00
This means on February 24, 2020, the algorithm bought 2.71 shares of the stock at a price of $73.85 per share.
Sell:
Example: Sell 2.7083330750465637 shares at 67.6720962524414 on 2020-04-13 00:00:00
This means on April 13, 2020, the algorithm sold those same 2.71 shares at a price of $67.67 per share.
Important Details in the Trade Log:
Shares: The number of shares purchased or sold. The number of shares is fractional because you are buying based on a portion of your balance (determined by the risk_per_trade parameter).
Price: The stock price at which the shares were bought or sold.
Date: The date when the buy or sell transaction was executed.
